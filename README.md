#Fruit Image Annotation Project

##Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in image annotation for computer vision.  
I used **CVAT** (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) to annotate a fruit dataset by drawing bounding boxes around different fruit categories and labeling them appropriately.  

The dataset includes classes such as:
- Apple
- Apricot
- Avocado
- Banana
- Blueberry
- Cactus Fruit
- Kiwi
- Lime
- Mango

These annotations are stored in a structured format along with a `labelmap.txt` file, which defines the class labels and assigns visualization colors.

---

## Objective
The goal of this project is to prepare a high-quality labeled dataset that can be used to train **object detection and classification models** in machine learning and computer vision.

---

## Tools & Techniques
- **Annotation Tool:** [CVAT](https://cvat.ai/)  
- **Annotation Type:** Bounding Box Annotation  
- **Label Management:** `labelmap.txt` defining class names and colors  
- **Output Format:** Pascal VOC 1.1

---

## Key Takeaways
- Hands-on experience with image annotation workflows 
- Built a structured dataset ready for AI/ML model training 
- Developed understanding of label maps and multi-class object detection 

---

## Next Steps
- Expand annotations to more categories  
- Train a baseline object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) using this dataset  
- Continue building a portfolio of computer vision projects
